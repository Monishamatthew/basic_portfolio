    ABOUT ME
  <p>Hi, I'm Monisha â€” a passionate and curious front-end developer with a keen eye for design and detail. I enjoy bringing ideas to life through clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces. My journey in front-end development is driven by a love for creating intuitive digital experiences that not only look great but also function seamlessly across devices. I take pride in writing well-structured HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm constantly exploring new frameworks and tools to stay current with industry trends.
  </p>
  <p>
I'm especially drawn to the intersection of design and technology, where creativity meets code. Whether it's optimizing performance, enhancing accessibility, or collaborating with designers and back-end developers, I strive to deliver high-quality results. I believe in continuous learning and am always eager to take on new challenges that help me grow both technically and professionally.
